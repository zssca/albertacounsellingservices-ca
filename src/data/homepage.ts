A registered psychologist has undergone rigorous training and is licensed to practice in Calgary.

Equally important is the personal connection—you should feel comfortable and supported during your sessions.

    {
      id: "family-vs-couples",

Family counselling involves working with multiple family members to address relational dynamics, improve communication, and resolve conflicts within the family unit. It aims to create a harmonious and supportive environment for all members. On the other hand, couples counselling focuses exclusively on the relationship between partners, addressing issues such as communication, trust, and intimacy. In Calgary, our psychologists specialize in both family and couples counselling to meet the diverse needs of our clients."
